My name is Jeremiah Bess, and I am a Cybersecurity Defender. My interest in computers began at a very young age, however my career in Cyber started when I joined the Air Force in 2004. I worked for a few years at a MSSP. Currently I am an Incident Responder.

This blog is my small way of giving back to the community. I hope my posts are of value. If you think so, feel free to drop me line in email, Twitter, or LinkedIn.
